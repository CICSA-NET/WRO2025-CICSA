## Mobility Management.
====

**Design Objectives**

The mobility system was designed to meet the following goals:

- **Precision**: Achieve controlled movement and accurate steering.
- **Stability**: Maintain balance and traction across varied surfaces.
- **Mechanical Efficiency**: Use gear ratios to optimize torque and speed.
- **Adaptability**: Respond effectively to terrain changes and obstacles.


**Gear Transmission**: Power is delivered from the motors to the wheels through a custom gear system. Gear ratios were selected to enhance torque for low-speed control and obstacle negotiation.

Mobility is a key factor in robotic performance, especially in competitive environments where precision, stability, and adaptability are essential. This document outlines the mechanical and software strategies used to manage the robot's mobility, featuring a gear-based transmission system and directional control via a servomotor.

<img width="841" height="316" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f6f4bb1-04b4-4737-a7f4-04a1430fb224" />



The gear transmission is a mechanical system that allows for the modification of angular velocity and torque between two connected shafts. This is achieved by coupling two gears: a driving gear (coupled to the motor) and a driven gear (coupled to the load or wheel).

Based on the previous terms, we use them in the robot as follows:

1. For the free challenge, it is required that the robot has more speed than torque, which is why the driven gear has 54 teeth in relation to the driving gear of 32. If we apply the principle of conservation of mechanical power,
  
   where:  RT =   driven gear teeth / driving gear teeth = 54 / 32 = **1.68**

   
2. For the obstacle challenge, it is required that the robot moves slowly and with more torque, resulting in the driven gear for this particular challenge having 32 teeth and the driving gear having 54, so that by applying the principle of conservation of power, a decrease in speed is obtained, but torque increases in the following proportion:


   where:  RT =   driven gear teeth / driving gear teeth = 32 / 54 = **0.59**


The motor is controlled using the pulse width modulation technique. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a widely used technique for controlling the speed of DC motors by adjusting the effective voltage applied to the motor terminals. Instead of varying the actual supply voltage, PWM rapidly switches the motor‚Äôs power on and off at a fixed frequency, modulating the duration of the ‚Äúon‚Äù time within each cycle‚Äîthis is known as the duty cycle. The motor‚Äôs speed is directly influenced by the duty cycle of the PWM signal. A higher duty cycle means the motor receives power for a greater portion of each cycle, resulting in a higher average voltage and increased rotational speed. Conversely, a lower duty cycle reduces the average voltage and slows the motor down. The configuration parameters are shown below:


**These are the parameters defined for the open-category challenge:**


enable = PWM(Pin(21), freq=1000)        # Motor PWM enable

enable.duty_u16(35000)                  # Set duty cycle to ~53.4%



- Pin(21): Refers to GPIO pin 21 on the microcontroller (ESP32). This pin is physically connected to the motor driver‚Äôs (L298N) enable input, which expects a PWM signal.
- PWM(...): Initializes a PWM object on that pin.
- freq=1000: Sets the PWM frequency to 1000 Hz (1 kHz), meaning the signal completes 1000 cycles per second.
- duty_u16(...): Sets the duty cycle using a 16-bit value (range: 0 to 65535).
- 35000: Represents the ‚Äúon‚Äù time of the PWM signal. The duty cycle percentage is:
  Duty Cycle(%) = (35000 / 65535) * 100                **approx 53.4\%**
- This means the signal is high (ON) for 53.4%.
- Average Voltage: The motor receives approximately 53.4% of the supply voltage. If V = 11.1 V, then:
  V = 11.1V * 0.534      **approx 6V**


Based on the measured values and the technical specifications provided by the manufacturer, the following results are obtained:

**The following parameters were defined for the obstacle challenge:**

- 26000: Represents the ‚Äúon‚Äù time of the PWM signal. The duty cycle percentage is:
  Duty Cycle(%) = (26000 / 65535) * 100                **approx 39.6\%**
- This means the signal is high (ON) for 39.6%.
- Average Voltage: The motor receives approximately 39.6% of the supply voltage. If V = 11.1 V, then:
  V = 11.1V * 0.396      **approx 4.39V**

**Directional Control**: A high-precision servomotor is used to steer the front axle, allowing for smooth and responsive turns. This setup mimics real-world vehicle steering and improves maneuverability in tight spaces.

The foundation of our chassis design is based on a steering configuration known as the parallel steering model, in which both front wheels turn at the same angle when steering input is applied. This approach, while mechanically straightforward, provides a reliable baseline for mobile robot steering systems‚Äîespecially when simplicity, symmetry, and ease of implementation are key priorities.


<img width="541" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f82ad7a-f967-4f60-8227-f051eb56edba" />

In short, parallel steering was chosen because it strikes a balance between functionality and feasibility. It enables reliable performance while keeping the mechanical and computational demands accessible‚Äîperfect for STEM education, prototyping, and early-stage competition builds.

The selection was based mainly on the following reasons:

1. Mechanical Simplicity
- The parallel steering model allows both front wheels to turn at the same angle using a single servo or mirrored linkage system.
- This reduces the number of moving parts and avoids the need for complex geometry or differential steering mechanisms.
2. Ease of Control
- From a programming standpoint, controlling a single angle for both wheels is straightforward.
- It simplifies PID tuning, sensor feedback loops, and integration with basic autonomous navigation systems.
3. Modular Compatibility
- Many commercial chassis kits (like those using MG996R servos or JGA25-370 motors) are designed with parallel steering in mind.
- This makes it easier to integrate with off-the-shelf components and adapt to different platforms.
4. Symmetry and Predictability
- Parallel steering provides predictable turning behavior, which is useful for line-following, maze-solving, or path planning in competition environments.
- It also simplifies documentation, calibration, and debugging.

**Chassis Adaptation and Structural Enhancements**: 

A commercial chassis kit was initially acquired as the mechanical foundation for the robot. However, significant structural and functional improvements were implemented to optimize device integration and system stability.
Custom mounting platforms were designed and fabricated to securely accommodate key components such as the ESP32 microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi 5 single-board computer, the camera module, and the sensor array. These modifications involved redesigning the original base plates to ensure precise alignment, vibration damping, and thermal clearance for high-performance operation.
The updated design also includes reinforced brackets and modular supports that facilitate rapid maintenance and component replacement during competition. These enhancements substantially diverge from the original kit layout, resulting in a more robust, competition-ready architecture.
The following technical drawings illustrate the custom adaptations made to the chassis, highlighting the engineering rationale behind each modification and its impact on system performance. The most critical structural adaptations are presented below. These modifications were implemented to enhance component stability, optimize spatial distribution, and improve overall system integration.
Full CAD models and detailed design files can be found in the  folder, including all custom mounts, sensor brackets, and revised base plates. These designs reflect substantial changes to the original kit configuration, tailored to meet the specific demands of the obstacle and open-category challenges.

One sensor is mounted on the right side of the vehicle to work in conjunction with the PID controller, maintaining a specific distance from the wall. Another sensor is placed on the left side, performing the same function on the opposite side. A third sensor is positioned facing forward to monitor when the robot approaches the front wall.

**Power Supply Strategy**

The power system is designed to support motors, servos, microcontrollers, and sensors simultaneously. Key considerations includes two challenges, each powered by a different voltage source.
For the open challenge and the obstacle challenge, the system is powered by a battery that supplies 5200 mA.
Detailed battery specifications are provided below

- **Battery type**  
  - Battery LiPo HOOVO 11.1V 3S 5200mAh 60C

- **Power regulation**  
  - Buck converters or dedicated power rails to prevent voltage drops and protect sensitive components

**Sensor Selection and Justification**
Three sensors were selected to provide the robot with positioning information on the track.
They were mounted on the front of the robot: one on the right side, one on the left side, and one in the center.
This configuration allows the robot to detect lateral boundaries and maintain alignment during navigation.

The side-mounted sensors provide the system with distance measurements between the robot and the lateral walls.
A PID control algorithm was implemented to maintain a consistent, predefined distance from these walls during navigation.
The center sensor supplies data regarding the robot‚Äôs proximity to the front wall, enabling forward obstacle detection and alignment.
Each sensor contributes to navigation, obstacle detection, or environmental awareness:

| Sensor       | Purpose                     | Protocol | Power Notes         |
|--------------|-----------------------------|----------|----------------------|
| 3.- URM37V5.0    | Distance measurement        | Digital  | Low consumption      |


**System Integration Overview**

A wiring diagram and bill of materials (BOM) will be included to illustrate:

- Power distribution across all components.
- Voltage regulation.
- Microcontroller pin mapping.
- Sensor interconnections and shielding.

## Obstacle management.
====

This system pairs a Raspberry Pi 5 vision producer with an ESP32 motion controller for WRO 2025. On the Pi 5, WRO_headless.py captures frames via Picamera2, crops a horizontal ROI to focus compute, converts to HSV, and segments red (two hue bands for wraparound) and green. A 5√ó5 morphological opening suppresses noise; external contours are extracted and the largest blobs are measured. Detections below a minimum area are ignored; exceeding a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù area flags an immediate pillar. The Pi compares critical red vs green and sends a single byte‚Äî'R', 'G', or 'C'‚Äîover UART at 115200 baud. The ESP32 (MicroPython) reads this on UART2 (TX=GPIO17, RX=GPIO16), drives motors with LEDC PWM, and positions the steering servo at calibrated LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT bounds. Ultrasonic distances (HC-SR04 style via time_pulse_us) refresh continuously. A wall-following PID (tunable KP/KI/KD, DT) steers each cycle; on 'R'/'G', a lane-change primitive boosts speed, steers diagonally with a minimum hold, requires a lateral distance delta or times out, then counter-turns and recovers before PID resumes. A debounced corner routine triggers when front distance stays below threshold. Calibrate HSV, ROI, area gates, PID gains, and maneuver timings.
The connection diagram is shown in section schemes.
The source code is in section src.
